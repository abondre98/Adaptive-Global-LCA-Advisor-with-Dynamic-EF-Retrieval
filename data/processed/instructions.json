Start with the emission factor for conventional nuclear power as a baseline (254.1 kg CO2e/USD). 2. Apply an adjustment factor based on available lifecycle assessment studies for similar sustainable alternatives. 3. Document your assumptions and data sources clearly. 4. Consider using sensitivity analysis to understand how variations in the emission factor might impact your overall results. 5. Update your calculations when more specific emission factors become available. This approach provides a reasonable estimate while acknowledging the uncertainty in emerging product categories.",
