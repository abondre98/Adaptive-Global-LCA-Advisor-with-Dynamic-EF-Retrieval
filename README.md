# Adaptive Global LCA Advisor with Dynamic EF Retrieval

## Carbon Footprint Recommendation System

## Overview

This project aims to develop an AI-powered system that provides region-specific **emission factor (EF)** recommendations for accurate carbon accounting. The approach integrates **fine-tuned LLMs** with **dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to enable real-time EF updates.

## Business Use Case

### Problem Statement

- A significant percentage of food products lack environmental impact labels, leading to **inconsistent carbon footprint calculations**.
- Manual selection of emission factors introduces **15-30% error rates** due to outdated or regionally incorrect data.
- Regulatory requirements, such as the **EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)**, necessitate **precise regional EF mapping** for compliance.

### Solution

- **Automated EF recommendations** tailored to specific regions (e.g., wheat production in different countries).
- **Real-time EF retrieval** leveraging AI and structured databases.
- **Web and mobile interface** for supply chain managers and auditors.

## Usage

Run the main script to execute the entire pipeline:

python data/scripts/main.py
```

This will:

1. Download and extract data from all sources (or use simulated data if sources are unavailable)
2. Clean and standardize each dataset
3. Harmonize all datasets into a unified format
4. Generate a summary report and metadata

## Pipeline Steps

### 1. Data Extraction

Each dataset has a dedicated extractor module that:

- Downloads data from the source (or creates simulated data if unavailable)
- Extracts relevant files
- Validates the data structure

#### Dataset-Specific Extraction Processes:

- **Agribalyse 3.1**: Attempts to download from multiple official sources with robust validation; falls back to an enhanced simulated dataset with 2,793 food products across 28 detailed categories, representing the actual distribution of the official Agribalyse database. The extractor includes improved error handling, encoding detection, and comprehensive validation to ensure data quality.
- **USEEIO v2.1**: Clones the EPA GitHub repository and extracts emission factor data from CSV files
- **EXIOBASE 3.8**: Attempts to download from Zenodo; falls back to simulated data with 1,030 product-country combinations
- **Climate TRACE**: Simulates real-time emissions data for 50 sectors across multiple regions
- **IPCC AR6**: Enhanced extractor that uses advanced PDF parsing techniques to extract tables and figures from the IPCC AR6 WG3 report, particularly from Chapter 2 (Emissions Trends and Drivers). The extractor now includes:
  - **Expanded Regional Coverage**: 25 regions (up from 10), including specific countries and regional groupings
  - **Detailed Sectoral Breakdown**: 27 sectors (up from 8), representing the subsectors mentioned in the IPCC report
  - **Time Series Data**: Includes multipliers for four time periods (1990-2000, 2000-2010, 2010-2019, 2019-present)
  - **Gas-Specific Multipliers**: Separate multipliers for different greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, F-gases)
  - **PDF Extraction**: Utilizes libraries like PyMuPDF and Camelot for accurate table and figure extraction
- **OpenLCA**: Attempts to access the OpenLCA Nexus; falls back to simulated data with 961 processes
- **IPCC EFDB**: Simulates emission factors for various sectors and gases across different regions
- **GREET Model**: Simulates transportation fuel lifecycle emissions for various fuel pathways and vehicle technologies

### 2. Data Cleaning

The cleaning process for each dataset:

- Standardizes column names
- Converts values to appropriate data types
- Removes duplicates and invalid entries
- Detects outliers (using statistical methods)
- Creates a standardized schema

### 3. Data Harmonization

The harmonization process:

- Creates a crosswalk between similar entities across datasets
- Standardizes units to kg CO2e
- Applies regional multipliers from IPCC AR6
- Merges all datasets into a single harmonized dataset
- Generates metadata and a summary report

### 4. Quality Assurance

- **Completeness**: Ensures >95% of critical fields are populated
- **Consistency**: Cross-references between datasets to flag discrepancies
- **Accuracy**: Validates against known benchmarks
- **Timeliness**: Flags data older than 3 years for review
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifies statistical outliers in emission factor values
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Ensures no duplicate records exist in the final dataset

## Output Files

## Enhanced IPCC AR6 Extractor

The IPCC AR6 extractor has been significantly enhanced to provide a more comprehensive and detailed dataset. Key improvements include:

### 1. Enhanced PDF Extraction

- Implemented advanced PDF parsing techniques using PyMuPDF and Camelot
- Created specialized functions to extract tables and figures from PDF documents
- Added a specific function to target Chapter 2 (Emissions Trends and Drivers) of the IPCC AR6 WG3 report

### 2. Expanded Regional Coverage

- Increased from 10 to 25 regions
- Added specific countries (USA, China, India, etc.)
- Included new regional groupings (EU, MENA, LDCs, etc.)
- Mapped all regions to standardized ISO codes

### 3. Detailed Sectoral Breakdown

- Expanded from 8 to 27 sectors
- Added detailed subsectors for energy, industry, transport, buildings, and AFOLU
- Aligned with the IPCC AR6 reporting structure

### 4. Time Series Data

- Added data for four distinct time periods:
  - 1990-2000 (Historical baseline)
  - 2000-2010 (Growth period)
  - 2010-2019 (Improvement period)
  - 2019-present (Recent improvements)
- Each multiplier includes time-specific adjustments

### 5. Gas-Specific Multipliers

- Created separate multipliers for:
  - CO2 (Carbon dioxide)
  - CH4 (Methane)
  - N2O (Nitrous oxide)
  - F-gases (Fluorinated gases)
- Each gas has specific adjustment factors based on typical emission patterns

These enhancements have expanded the IPCC AR6 dataset from 88 records to 10,769 records, providing much more detailed and specific multipliers for accurately adjusting emission factors across regions, sectors, time periods, and gas types.
